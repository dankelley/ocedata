    image from March 2014 that covers Nova Scotia and portions of the Bay of

\usage{data(landsat)}

\source{The original data were downloaded from the USGS earthexplorer website,
    \url{http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov}, although other sites can also be used
    to uncover it by name.  The code below shows how the dataset was created.
    The decimation by 60 reduces file size from about 1GB to 0.3Mb.
