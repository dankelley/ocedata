\title{Seawater CTD profile, without trimming of extraneous data}

\description{This is sample CTD profile provided for testing.  It
  includes not just the (useful) portion of the dataset during which the
  instrument was being lowered, but also data from the upcast and from
  time spent near the surface.  Spikes are also clearly evident in the
  pressure record.  With such real-world wrinkles, this dataset provides
  a good example of data that need trimming with
  \code{\link{ctdTrim}}.}

\usage{data(ctdRaw)}
\source{The data were acquired near the centre of 
the Bedford Basin of the Halifax Harbour, during an 
October 2003 field trip of Dalhousie University's 
Oceanography 4120/5120 class.}

    of CTD objects, and also outlines the other functions dealing with them.}
