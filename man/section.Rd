\description{A CTD section running the length of Halifax Harbour}
\usage{data(section)}

\source{This section is based on measurements made during October of 2003 in
    Halifax Harbour by students in Dan Kelley's \emph{Introduction to Physical
        Oceanography} class at Dalhousie University.  The course was taught by
    the author of this package, and supervision at sea was provided by N.
    Bernier, who was then a PhD student at Dalhousie. Note the alteration of
    two station locations, to correct errors in transcribing field notes (e.g.
    a hand-written \code{8} was evidently typed as \code{3}).

The stations cover a 14 km region running from station 308, near the
Sackville River, seaward to station 315, at the entrance to the general
Harbour, offshore of the aptly-named Point Pleasant Park.
