`ocedata` supplies some oceanographic datasets, for general use and as an
adjunct to the `oce` package. Indeed, some of the datasets were once supplied
by `oce`, but they were moved to `ocedata` as a way to reduce storage pressure
on the CRAN system, assuming that `oce` will be updated more frequently than
`ocedata`.
